# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch 

Welcome to my Etch-A-Sketch project! This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum where you build a virtual Etch-A-Sketch toy that allows users to draw on a grid using various functionalities.

## Description

This Etch-A-Sketch project aims to recreate the classic drawing toy in a digital format using web technologies. Users will be able to draw on a grid with their mouse or touchpad, clear the drawing, and change the size of the grid.
